# Learning: Sync and transcode music files

My car's built-in computer only plays mp3 files. This project looks at source and destination files, then transcodes missing music files to mp3 so they can be played on the car's USB stick.

## Development process

I'm using GitHub Copilot as much as possible to develop this project so that I can learn about its capabilities and limitations.

## Usage

Coming soon.

## Tests
